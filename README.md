# tree-playground
experimenting with the idea of lightning (verkle) vectors of values through an assembled tree to compliment or replace time dial guiding side quests in a structured binary tree format. treeB currently just mirrors treeA

### todo experiments
- consider adding ai to mirrored tree for more probabilistic outcomes
- routing randomness from geospaced ttl internet loops
- differing starting root nodes, so not always the same entry/exit, possible integrated into other time-like systems
