# tree-playground
experimenting with the idea of lightning (verkle) vectors of values through an assembled tree to compliment or replace time dial guiding side quests in a structured binary tree format. treeB currently just mirrors treeA

## todo experiments
- consider adding ai to mirrored tree for more probabilistic outcomes
- routing randomness from geospaced ttl internet loops
- differing starting root nodes, so not always the same entry/exit, possible integrated into other time-like systems

## example output
```
Path in TreeA:  [
  'Spindle 𐂷 OIR',
  '☿',
  'Hawthon 𐂷 HUATHE',
  'Blackthorn 𐂷 STRAIF',
  'Apple 𐂷 QUERT',
  'Ivy 𐂷 GORT',
  'Vine 𐂷 MUIN'
]
Path in TreeB:  [ 'WOOD', '⇠', '⚯', 'DESERT_JASPER', '꩜', 'PINK_AMETHYST' ]
